Figma plugin import fails: afterCreate for "Fixed Container" throws TypeError: not a function; createNode fails for FRAME node_801; NodeBuilder returns null; then CRITICAL: All 7 child nodes failed → blank white frame (failedNodes=7). Find the exact symbol being called as a function, why it’s not callable, and patch it with file+line evidence. Also handle nodes with hasLayout:true/hasRect:false safely, and ensure telemetry POST 127.0.0.1:7242/ingest ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED cannot abort import. Output: root cause, evidence, copy/paste patch, validation steps.
